Problem:

It seems everyone today has multiple digital streaming services, with new ones being added every day.  It is impossible to keep them organized.

Solution:

Our database service will help users parse through the available titles on all of their connected streaming accounts, allowing them to sit back and watch Road House with as little hassle as possible.

Utilization:

Our service utilizes the uNoGS API through rapidAPI to search through the Netflix catalog and provide response to user queries.  Users will be able to specify different parameters and filters to streamline and personalize their experience.

The Future:

By utilizing various other entertainment platforms and services, Underthink could become a one-stop shop for all things sloth.  Possible utilities could include Uber Eats/GrubHub, Spotify, and Google Home.
